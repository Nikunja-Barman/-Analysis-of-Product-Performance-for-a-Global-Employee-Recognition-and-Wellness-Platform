# Project Title: 
Analysis of Product Performance for a Global Employee Recognition and Wellness Platform

# Introduction: 
The aim of this data analysis project is to evaluate the performance of a customer rewarding product offered by a global employee recognition and wellness platform. The objective is to build a suitable statistical model to analyze the key factors affecting the performance of the product.

# Data: 
The data used for this project was obtained from the company's database and includes customer usage data for the customer rewarding product over a period of 3 months. The data contains information on the number of times the product was used, the number of customers who used the product, the type of rewards offered, and the overall satisfaction ratings of the customers.

# Methodology: 
The first step in the analysis was to clean and preprocess the data. This involved removing any missing or invalid data and normalizing the variables to ensure that they were on the same scale. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was then conducted to gain insights into the distribution and relationships between the variables.The next step was to identify the key factors that affect the performance of the product. This was done using correlation analysis and feature selection techniques. A regression model was then developed to predict the performance of the product based on the identified factors.

# Insights:
1. Top Receiver per month.
2. Monthly analysis of Total Points received.
3. Avg. points received by the users per week.
4. Top countries on the basis of active users.
5. Top awarding managers.
6. Avg. points given by each managers per week.
7. Monthly analysis of total points given by each manager.
8. Retention analysis of points used per month by each company(cohort analysis)
and
A Statistical model to analyze the key factors affecting the performance of the product.

# Results: 
The results of the analysis showed that the frequency of product usage, the type of rewards offered, and the satisfaction ratings of the customers were the most significant factors affecting the performance of the product. The developed regression model had a high degree of accuracy in predicting the performance of the product.

# Conclusion: 
In conclusion, the analysis provides valuable insights into the performance of the customer rewarding product offered by the global employee recognition and wellness platform. The developed statistical model can be used by the company to optimize the product's performance and enhance customer satisfaction. The findings of the analysis are presented in a clear and concise manner using data visualizations and statistical tables, and the code for the analysis is available on GitHub for reproducibility and transparency.
